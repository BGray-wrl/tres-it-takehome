# Recommended Models

A list of generally strong up-to-date models on openrouter for a range of options. This list is not exhaustive, but it is a decent starting point.

**Note:** this list has small models, but none that are suitable for a huggingface download to run local experiments (at least on an A100). Those would need to be much smaller.

Fixed model list for CLI selection, enriched with metadata from OpenRouter.

- **Tokenizer:** Llama3
- **Instruct type:** —
- **Description:** Llama-3.3-Nemotron-Super-49B-v1.5 is a 49B-parameter, English-centric reasoning/chat model derived from Meta’s Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct with a 128K context. It’s post-trained for agentic workflows (RAG, tool calling) via SFT across math, code, science, and multi-turn chat, followed by multiple RL stages; Reward-aware Preference Optimization (RPO) for alignment, RL with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) for step-wise reasoning, and iterative DPO to refine tool-use behavior. A distillation-driven Neural Architecture Search (“Puzzle”) replaces some attention blocks and varies FFN widths to shrink memory footprint and improve throughput, enabling single-GPU (H100/H200) deployment while preserving instruction following and CoT quality.

In internal evaluations (NeMo-Skills, up to 16 runs, temp = 0.6, top_p = 0.95), the model reports strong reasoning/coding results, e.g., MATH500 pass@1 = 97.4, AIME-2024 = 87.5, AIME-2025 = 82.71, GPQA = 71.97, LiveCodeBench (24.10–25.02) = 73.58, and MMLU-Pro (CoT) = 79.53.
